<p>Book fair is an occasion where lots of books are sold and displayed. It has been a popular trend and being arranged all across the world. In Bangladesh and India mostly book fairs are arranged in International Mother Language Day or Independence Day.
    It is a very good arrangement for book lovers.</p>

<p>You can see lots of types of books there. I feel so good in a book fair. I visited one a couple of weeks ago and that was a very pleasant experience for me. Books are our good friend and we need to read lots of books regularly.</p>

<p>Books are undeniably a blessing to humankind. And books being useful for us in many ways have earned the title of our best friend. Libraries are the storehouse of books of several genres where interested readers can spend time reading in silence or can
    borrow books by being a member of that library. Through this practice of reading, we humans also display a greater sense of being civilized.</p>

<p>There are individuals like myself who like to collect books, especially storybooks or novels. And this habit of mine has turned my house into a small library in itself. I know many other readers who share this same obsession with reading books and collecting
    them. My conversions with them mostly revolve around the plot, the character development, the writing style of the authors, and other aspects of books.</p>

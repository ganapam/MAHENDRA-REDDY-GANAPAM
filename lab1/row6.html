            <td><b>About the Book: Death : An Inside Story</b> Death is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we have got this completely wrong? What if death was not the catastrophe it is made out to be but an essential aspect of life, rife
                with spiritual possibilities for transcendence? For the first time, someone is saying just that. In this unique treatise-like exposition, Sadhguru dwells extensively upon his inner experience as he expounds on the more profound aspects
                of death that are rarely spoken about. From a practical standpoint, he elaborates on what preparations one can make for ones death, how best we can assist someone who is dying and how we can continue to support their journey even after
                death. Whether a believer or not, a devotee or an agnostic, an accomplished seeker or a simpleton, this is truly a book for all those who shall die!..

                And her life turns upside down. Basheer Ali, a senior inspector at the CBI, has captured many criminals. But he has seen many more walk free. So, even as he works to track down Yama—a vigilante killer bringing the corrupt and guilty outed
                on social media to fatal justice—he finds himself grudgingly siding with a killer. Through the dark and gritty streets of Delhi, Dhruvi and Basheer chase this spectre of the God of Death, each step leading up to a final choice that makes
                them question their own morality. Can one man decide anothers fate? Is rage the real way to justice?
